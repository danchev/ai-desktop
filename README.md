# Ollama Desktop Client (Electron)

Fork of the original Gemini Desktop Client by [nekupaw](https://github.com/nekupaw/gemini-desktop) with modifications for self-hosted Ollama interface.

Precompiled versions for macOS and Windows are available for download here:
[Windows (Setup)](https://github.com/danchev/ollama-desktop/releases/download/0.0.2/Ollama-Desktop.Setup.0.0.2.exe)

For other systems, simply adapt and build the source code to suit your needs.

This client operates by utilizing a WebView container to access the Ollama website and implements various modifications for enhanced user experience.
With the shortcut Ctrl + G, Ollama can be opened from anywhere.
tip: use the installer and copy the shortcut from the desktop to the startup folder.
