# Ollama Desktop Client (Electron)
I've developed a straightforward desktop client for Ollama using the Electron framework.

Precompiled versions for macOS and Windows are available for download here:
[Windows (Setup)](https://github.com/danchev/ollama-desktop/releases/download/1.0.7/Ollama-Desktop.Setup.1.0.7.exe))
[macOS-arm64 (dmg)](https://github.com/danchev/ollama-desktop/releases/download/1.0.3/Ollama-Desktop.mac-arm64.dmg)


For other systems, simply adapt and build the source code to suit your needs.

This client operates by utilizing a WebView container to access the Ollama website and implements various modifications for enhanced user experience.
With the shortcut Ctrl + G, Ollama can be opened from anywhere.
tip: use the installer and copy the shortcut from the desktop to the startup folder.
